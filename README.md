# Spotify-Clone
 This is my second Web Development project using HTML, CSS & Javascript. In this project, I will be making a Spotify Clone which is able to play/pause/like/unlike/play next or previous song. I have also hosted this project using a free subdomain.
 The new Artist will automatically be added to Popular Artist section of the webpage when the server containing songs folder is updated.
 Whenever you like a song under Songs section, the song will be added to Liked Songs under Your Library section and vice-versa.
 The page is responsive for mobile phones, tablets, laptops/PC's, or any other bigger resolution device.
